# Silly-story-generator-MDN

My version of MDN's Assessment: Silly story generator

The objective of this assignment is "to test comprehension
of JavaScript fundamentals, such as variables, numbers, operators, strings, and arrays." This is tested by having one write the 
needed JavaScript code to emulate the given program example. The main function of the program is to generate "a silly story".
